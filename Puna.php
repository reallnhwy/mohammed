	<p>If you're on your way to Hawaii Volcanoes National Park, follow Hawaii 11 to Volcano Village, a charming rainforest town known for its glass blowing and art galleries. Nestled within the forest at the 4,000 foot elevation, it offers a refreshing contrast to the beaches of West Hawaii and the hot, barren volcanic landscape a mere mile away. While you'll want to set aside some time to browse the galleries and have a bite to eat, Volcano Village is also a good place to fill in gas for your drive home.
