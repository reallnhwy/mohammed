	<p>The Festival includes innovative Kona coffee farm tours, native Hawaiian arts and culture events, keiki (child) friendly activities, and a celebration of cultural diversity blended together in 10 event-filled days honoring nearly 200 years of Kona coffee history.</p>	
	<p>Every cup of Kona's gourmet brew shares a story of coffee traditions that produced this American legacy. The theme of the 2014 Kona Coffee Cultural Festival, “Bringing Kona Together,” captures the multi-cultural heritage that has been percolating here on the leeward coast of Hawaii Island since 1828</p>
	<p>The Kona coffee story is one that is heard throughout America – hard work and commitment that cultivates the dream for a better life. Today, fifth and sixth generation Kona coffee farmers work alongside newcomers to cultivate more than 4,000 acres in coffee production. Approximately 600 independent Kona coffee farms continue to uphold the tradition of quality that has made Kona a coffee success.</p>
